# Welcome
This site gives the answers of some French books' exercises.  
The main idea is to help parents and pupils who are not familiar with French language to check whether their exercise is correct.  
Looking at the answers before trying to do the exercises first has (in my opinion) a poor learning impact and should be avoided.
